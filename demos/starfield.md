This was the third of a bunch of experiments with particle systems in THREE.js.

This demo makes a cool hyperspace starfield-like effect. It just moves the particles in one direction until they reach the end of a box. Then, it moves the particles back to the back of the box. In essence, this is like travelling through a giant 3-torus for the viewer.

If you have a large enough monitor, you can actually see the edge of the box by rotating far enough.
