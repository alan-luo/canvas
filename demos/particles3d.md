**Controls:**

- Move the mouse.

This was the first of a bunch of experiments with particle systems in THREE.js. I had already been messing with particle systems for a while, so when I first started using THREE, particles were the first thing I tried to figure out.

This demo is nothing too special, it's just generating a bunch of particles at random points with random colors with basic mouse control.
